		<div class = "text">
			The first European visit to San Diego was in 1542 led by a Spaniard named Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo.
			In 1821, Mexico drove the Spanish out of the San Diego territory in the Mexican War of Independence
			and created the Province of Alta California. Alta California was then acquired by the US in 1848 following 
			the US victory of the Mexican-American War. San Diego became a crucial part of the expansion of US territory
			in the late 1800's, and soon became "The Gibraltar of the Pacific". San Diego hosted two World's Fairs from
			1915 to 1916, each one leaving a piece of history such as Balboa Park and the San Diego Zoo.

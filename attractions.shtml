			A great thing about San Diego is that it is definitely not lacking in the
			attractions department, there is always something to do. From museums to theme parks
			there will always be something that will satisfy your entertainment needs. If you happen
			to be in San Diego between June 11th to July 4th, then be sure to visit the <a href = "sdcf.shtml">San Diego
			County Fair</a> in Del Mar.

			The San Diego County Fair is not a fair to be missed if you're a local. The fair is the
			perfect kick-off to the summer by providing both thrill seeking rides and unheatlthy foods.
			The County fair hosts many of the craziest food vendors San Diego has to offer, delivering 
			foods such as french toast bacon and deep fried nachos. But be cautious when deciding to go on
			a ride right after you've eaten, the two definitely don't mix well. The county fair by the beach
			is one of the best attractions that will keep you entertained the entire day. Don't forget to
			Put on sunscreen!

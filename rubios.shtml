			Rubio's makes any other Mexican restaraunt look like fools, especially every taco tuesday when their legendary
			fish taco gets priced at $2 each. Rubio's makes great use of the San Diego fishing areas, creating
			one of a kind seafood meals such as the Grilled Shrimp Burrito, which can include bacon if you're really
			trying to get the most out of your burrito. With each dish having a distinct and unique flavor, 
			they all end up making your day.

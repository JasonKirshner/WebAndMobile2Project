		<!-- About the webpage -->
		<div class = "text">
			The 47th annual Comic-Con at the San Diego Convention Center has just ended and again has helped boost the local economy. Twitch-Con,
			a convention for the popular streaming website for gaming, is currently being held in the San Diego Convention Center. These two conventions
			are continuously being held in San Diego because of the ideality of the location San Diego is in. In July the MLB All-Star game was hosted
			at Petco Park in downtown San Diego which provided the local businesses with a massive increase in business and the locals with a chance
			to meet MLB All-Stars the entire week before the game.

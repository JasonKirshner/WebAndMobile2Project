		<h1>Design of the UI</h1>
		
		<div class = "text">
			✔ It isobvious to a site visitor that all pages are part of the same site.<br/>
			✔ Good use of Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity Principles.<br/>
			✔ Site title, logo, formatting (page title, content, navigation) are the same on all pages.<br/>
			✔ The global navigation system isaccessible on all pages. In other words, a site visitor isable to jump to any top-level page from any other page within the site.</br>
			✔ The visitor always knows where they are in the site, and what to do to go ‘home’.<br/>
			✔ The siteiseasy to navigate –both between pages and within pages.<br/>
			✔ Long content has a ‘go to top’ link.<br/>
			✔ Page titles (title tags) reflect the actual content of the page.<br/>
			✔ A modernColor Scheme is used and it is appropriate to the place <br/>
			✔ Font Family is appropriate to the site and several different fonts are used for interest<br/>
			✔ Pages demonstrate a variety of layouts to keep the users’ interest<br/>
			✔ Images for viewing on smaller devices are appropriateto the screen size
		</div>
		
		<h1>Structure</h1>
		<div class = "text">
			✔ Any repeated HTML code is contained in an SSI and not coded throughout the site<br/>
			✔ Code your style in only ONE css file<br/>
			✔ All style is contained in the external css file –no inline or embedded cssunless justified with comments<br/>
			✔ A framework CSS file includes your grid layout and color scheme and other css that you will likely use in future websites.<br/>
			✔ Media queries are used so users can view your site on smaller mobile devices.<br/>
			✔ HTML code is readable, indented, whitespaced, and commented<br/>
			✔ CSS code is readable, indented, whitespaced, and commented.<br/>
			✔ All pages validate<br/>
			✔ The site displays well across all major, modern browsers.<br/>
			✔ Images are resized so they load fast –do not simply change the width and height to fit them on the screen!<br/>
			✔ The site displays well on small screens suchas a mobile phone (This is important)<br/>
			✔ CSS3 is all your own. NO frameworks have been used –Absolutely NO Bootstrap!
		</div>
		
		<h1>Content</h1>
		<div class = "text">
			✔ The site has animage of a map that shows the place being described in this site. The place is clearly marked on the image. It is NOT a live Google Map<br/>
			✔ Sufficiently describes the place with a good amount of quality textual content.<br/>
			✔ Written so thatsite visitors would really want to visit this place<br/>
			✔ Appropriate and attractive images are well placed within the text, and sized appropriately.<br/>
			✔ Images have an appropriate URL link below for reference (if not created by you).<br/>
			✔ Onepage that documents allof the things you didthat satisfies the grading criteria–called “grade.html”<br/>
			✔ Site has the required number of pages (10 plus a grading page = 11 (or more))<br/>
			✔ Spelling and Grammarare excellent<br/>
			✔ Navigationto the grading page can be placed in the footer.
